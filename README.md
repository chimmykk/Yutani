# **Yutani - Crypto for Everyone, Everywhere**

> **"Crypto without the complexity. Money that flows through your daily life - calls, texts, social media, and beyond."**

## **Development Phase - Prototype Version**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is currently in development phase with no working case but prototype version. Not ready for production use.**

## **Our Vision: Crypto That Lives in Your Daily Life**

This platform makes cryptocurrency accessible through everyday communication channels. No need to understand wallets, private keys, or blockchain technology - just use the communication channels you already know and love.

**Optional Dashboard**: Users can connect to `dashboard.yutani.co` to link their social media accounts and map them to their wallet, creating a unified interface for managing crypto across all platforms.

### **The Problem This Solves**

- **Complexity Barrier**: Traditional crypto requires understanding wallets, keys, and blockchain concepts
- **Accessibility Gap**: Not everyone has the technical knowledge to use crypto safely
- **Integration Issues**: Crypto exists in isolation from daily communication tools
- **User Experience**: Current solutions are intimidating and user-unfriendly

### **Solution: Invisible Crypto Infrastructure**

This platform makes crypto as natural as sending a WhatsApp message or making a phone call. Users don't need to know they're using cryptocurrency - they just send and receive money through their preferred communication channels.
